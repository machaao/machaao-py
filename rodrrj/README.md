#Experience with machaao

My experience was pretty straight foward. Aside from the issues already resolved regarding the start() portion of the command line arguments, getting my bot ready to go was easy. I initially had some trouble as the "Create" button in MessengerX was still greyed out after I completed all the required fields. Once I got the token and updated the appropriate python file the bot was quickly up and running and repeating what I said. The process felt pretty straight forward and was of no challenge whatsoever.
